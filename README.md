# ogap-schemes
This Project specifies several schemes for messages published on the swiss official gazette portal. 
The XML Schemes are stored in the folder "schemes". The main schema contains the general elements which are mandatory for every publication type.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE: The current implementation of the API is classified as «unstable». Changes in the API may (and will most certainly) occur.** 

Currently avaliable Schemes:
- ogap-main.xsd --> The main Schema. Content Data is definied as Type "anyType".
- ogap-wa.xsd --> Schema description of publication type "Work-time authorisation"
- ogap-br.xsd --> Schema description of publication type "bankruptcies"
- ogap-cr.xsd --> Schema description of publication type "commercial register"
